Observations for linear version: 

The program run as soon as i clicked on run so we can say the program is very fast.
As we can see from the output text file the execution time for any number of elements 
is always 0 and the tetranacci value of i=10 is 56, and i=15 the value is 1490 until i=50 the 
tetranacci value goes up until 1154474488 so the program was very fast to run




Observations for multiple(exponential) version:

As we can see from our output text file the execution time for 5 elements was 4301 ns where the tetranacci value is 2
and the execution time for 10 elements was 53178 ns where the tetranacci value was 56. Moreover, the execution time for 
20 elements was 4009523 ns where the tetranacci value was 39649. As we move down the output file, we notice that 
the execution time for 40 elements was 548632455042 ns where the tetranacci value was 19878720128.
We can deduce that the execution time for the exponential tetranacci is very slow especially when i run for 50 elements the 
program took a few hours to run.
